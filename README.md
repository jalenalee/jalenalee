### 👋🏼 Hey! It's Jalena, welcome to my humble abode. 🌿

Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. But, now more than ever, we see how the world isn’t equitable to certain groups — like new immigrants with financial and language barriers, students that don’t go to desirable schools, freshman founders — leaving an uphill climb between the impact they’re capable of, and what society expects from them.

I currently am working to solve this problem:

🚧 By [working on a startup](https://bitswap.network/) that provides liquidity to social tokens which allows powers the next wave of social tokens 

💸 Through investing at a [student-run seed-stage venture fund](http://frontrow.vc/) and giving opportunities to founders who many overlook for being “too young”

Previously: 
🛍️ [Empowering small businesses](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/blog/shopify-order-editing)so that they are able to deal with the unpredictable nature of eCommerce 

🎒By working at a [startup that builds a unique income share agreement](https://ursa.io/) to fund immigrants looking for higher education, without having to bear the financial burden.


Underrepresented founders, immigrants, and data-enthusiasts have a passionate drive to change the world. However, opportunities — especially in underrepresented communities— are not distributed evenly. I want to do my part and even the starting line. 

I'm always looking for my next thing
